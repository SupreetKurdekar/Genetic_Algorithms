# Genetic_Algorithms
 Implementation of binary coded genetic algorithm.
 Implementation uses binary strings to encode continuous variables.
 The lengths of strings are adaptively taken as per specified resolution.
 fitness_function.py consists of numpy implementations of accepted benchmark functions.
